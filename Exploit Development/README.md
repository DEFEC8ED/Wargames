This is just a simple test of exploit development. I learnt how to write exploits on a vulnerable binary, that accept a single parameter - argv[1]

Tested on x86-64 and x86 Linux systems.
<br>
<b>vulnerable.c</b>
<br>
Compilation:
```
gcc vulnerable.c -m32 -z execstack -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -Wall
```
<br>
Vulnerability is lying on line 7:
```
strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
```
<br>
Goal:
is exploit this binary and execute arbitrary code or just call a function 'winner'.
